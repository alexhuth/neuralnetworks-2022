## Course Description
This course is an introduction to artificial neural networks and deep learning. The course will be organized into five modules: neural network basics, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, self-attention/transformer networks, and special topics (e.g. reinforcement learning, non-gradient learning, spiking neural networks).

### Course Aims and Outcomes
By the end of the course, you should understand and be able to implement a wide array of artificial neural networks, as well as broadly understanding the various issues and concerns that are important to consider when building neural networks.

### Format and Procedures
The majority of the course will consist of lectures by the professor or guest lecturers. On Tuesdays students will do short in-class quizzes. Homeworks will be submitted electronically.

### How to Succeed in this Course
Read the course materials. Ask questions if any topics are unclear. Be respectful of each other and the instructor. Have fun! :)

## Course Requirements
### Prerequisites
Students should have some previous programming experience (preferably in python) and basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus. Discuss your situation with the instructor if you think you might not fulfill these prerequisites.

### Syllabus and Text
This page serves as the syllabus for this course. This syllabus is subject to change; students who miss class are responsible for learning about any changes to the syllabus.

There is no required course text book. Readings will primarily come from papers and online sources, including tutorials.

Additional required readings will be made available for download from the schedule page of the course website.

### Quizzes and Homework Assignments
There will be no midterm or final exam.

There will be 5 homework assignments, 14 short in-class quizzes, and a final course project. Assignments will be posted as the semester progresses. Readings and exercises may change up to one week in advance of their due dates.

### Course Grade
There are several components to the class grade.

* Homeworks (50%): There will be 5 homework assignments. Each assignment is worth 10% of your course grade.
Only homeworks submitted on time will be eligible for full score (without an extension granted by the professor or TA).
Homeworks submitted between the due date and one week late will have 10% of the maximum score deducted (e.g. a score of 93% would become 83%).
Homeworks will not be accepted more than one week after the original due date.
* Quizzes (15%): There will be ~14 short in-class quizzes.
The lowest score will be dropped; the other 13 quizzes will be equally weighted.
* Project (35%): There will be a final project that will involve developing and building an artificial neural network. This can be done solo or in groups as large as 4. If working in a group, the contributions of each student must be clearly indicated in a section of the writeup.

  * Proposal (5% of course grade): Before embarking on the project, each student/group will submit a proposal describing the topic and goal of their project.
  * Writeup & presentation (30% of course grade): Each group will write up their project and create a video or live presentation, depending on course modality in May.
## Course Policies & Resources
### Late Homework & Extension Policy
Homework is due in class on the noted due date. Homework must be turned in on the due date in order to receive full credit. Homework turned in less than 1 week late will be accepted but the score will be penalized by 10%. Homework later than 1 week will not be accepted.

Late homework will also be accepted under exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical or family emergency) and at the discretion of the instructor (e.g. exceptional denotes a rare event) with no penalty. This policy allowing for exceptional circumstances is not a right, but a privilege and courtesy to be used when needed and not abused. Should you encounter such circumstances, simply email assignment to instructor and note "late submission due to exceptional circumstances". You do not need to provide any further justification or personally revealing information regarding the details.

### Academic Honor Code
You are encouraged to discuss problem sets with classmates, but all written submissions must reflect your own, original work. If you worked with other students on a problem set, please include their names in a statement like "I worked on this course with XX and YY" on the assignment. If in doubt, ask the instructor. Acts like plagiarism represent a serious violation of UT's Honor Code and standards of conduct:

http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis_plagiarism.php
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/conduct.php
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to severe disciplinary penalties, such as automatically failing the course and potentially being dismissed from the University. Don't risk it. Honor code violations ultimately harm yourself as well as other students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic honesty will be strictly enforced.

For further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs (Links to an external site.).

### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

### Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop (Links to an external site.)

### Student Accommodations
Students with a documented disability may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/ (Links to an external site.)

Please request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations
Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
Please notify me if any of the physical space is difficult for you

### Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.

### Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
